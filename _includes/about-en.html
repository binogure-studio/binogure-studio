      Binogure Studio is an <span class="emphasis">independent</span> video game studio based at Orthez (France). Our goal is to create brilliant, high quality games.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We love <span class="emphasis">free software</span>, as in free beer but also <span class="emphasis">as in freedom</span>.
      It means that to make our games we only use <span class="emphasis">FOSS software</span>: Blender for 3D modeling or video editing; Krita and Inkscape for art and game assets; and Godot Engine to create a game.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span class="emphasis">We sell games</span>, and we sell games only. You won't see any ad in our games. And because <span class="emphasis">we are all gamer</span>, we won't ever create any pay2win game.
      Our economic model is based on the <span class="emphasis">play2win</span> mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you get our games to play and not to gamble, you won't have to pay for loot-boxes containing random rewards.
      It might exist in some game, but you will get them <span class="emphasis">for free</span>.
